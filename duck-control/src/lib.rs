//! The robot control core: everything between reading the bus and writing it.
//!
//! Deliberately not a daemon. There is no tokio here, no socket, no systemd — `robotd`
//! owns all of that. The boundary is enforced by the compiler rather than by discipline,
//! which is what stops process concerns leaking into the code that drives motors.
//!
//! The control path it holds — model, bus, [`io::RobotIo`], observations, policy, safety — is
//! designed in `docs/design/robotd-design.md` §2.
